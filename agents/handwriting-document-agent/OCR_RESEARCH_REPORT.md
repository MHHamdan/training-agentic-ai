## üîç Research Overview

Based on comprehensive analysis of the latest OCR technologies and HuggingFace model landscape for 2024-2025, I have identified and integrated the most powerful free OCR models to dramatically improve the document analysis capabilities.

## üìä Current System Analysis

### Issues Identified:
- **Low confidence scores** (45% in screenshot)
- **Limited model availability** - fallback messages about missing transformers
- **Basic text extraction** - lacking advanced document understanding
- **No specialized handling** for different document types

### Root Cause:
The system was using basic TrOCR models without proper fallback mechanisms and lacked integration with the latest 2024-2025 state-of-the-art models.

### Model Loading Strategy
```python
def _load_ocr_models(self):
    """Intelligent model loading with fallbacks"""
    
    # 1. Try GOT-OCR2.0 (2024 state-of-art)
    try:
        self.processors["got_ocr"] = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("stepfun-ai/GOT-OCR-2.0-hf")
        self.models["got_ocr"] = AutoModel.from_pretrained("stepfun-ai/GOT-OCR-2.0-hf")
        return  # Use as primary if available
    except Exception:
        # Fallback to TrOCR models
        
    # 2. TrOCR models with size fallbacks (large ‚Üí base)
    for model_size in ["large", "base"]:
        # Load handwritten and printed variants
```
