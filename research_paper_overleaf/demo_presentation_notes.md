### How to Compile in Overleaf

1. **Upload** `demo_presentation.tex` to Overleaf
2. **Set compiler** to `pdfLaTeX`
3. **Set document class** - Already configured as beamer presentation
4. **Compile** - Single pass is sufficient

### Presentation Features

- **Madrid theme** - Professional appearance
- **Icons** - FontAwesome5 icons for visual appeal
- **Diagrams** - TikZ architecture diagram
- **Code snippets** - Project structure visualization
- **Tables** - Framework comparison and port mapping

### Speaking Points by Slide

#### Slide 3 - System Overview
- Emphasize the scale: 16 agents is significant
- Mention framework diversity as a key differentiator
- Docker deployment makes it production-ready

#### Slide 4 - Architecture
- Point out the hub-and-spoke design
- Explain how dashboard coordinates everything
- Note the separation of concerns by domain

#### Slide 5 - Framework Selection
- Each framework chosen for specific strengths
- Not about "best" framework, but right tool for the job
- Demonstrates real-world integration patterns

#### Slide 6-7 - Agent Portfolio
- Quick overview, don't go deep into each
- Highlight variety of use cases
- Mention ports for technical audience

#### Slide 8 - Key Features
- Multi-provider support prevents vendor lock-in
- Observability is crucial for production systems
- Docker makes deployment reproducible

#### Slide 10 - Demo Overview
- Set expectations for what they'll see
- Choose 2-3 agents to demonstrate based on audience
- Keep demos short and impactful

### Demo Flow Suggestions

1. **Start with Dashboard** (1 min)
   - Show overall system health
   - Demonstrate navigation

2. **Pick 2-3 Agents** (3-4 min each)
   - Financial Analysis - for business audience
   - Customer Support - for operations audience
   - Research Agent - for technical audience

3. **Show Integration** (2 min)
   - How agents can work together
   - Observability in action

### Customization Tips

- **For Technical Audience**: Focus on architecture, frameworks, implementation
- **For Business Audience**: Focus on use cases, ROI, practical applications
- **For Academic Audience**: Focus on research aspects, innovation, comparison

### Time Management

- **Presentation**: 5-7 minutes
- **Demo**: 10-15 minutes
- **Q&A**: 5-10 minutes
- **Total**: 20-30 minutes

### Common Questions to Prepare For

1. Why multiple frameworks instead of one?
2. How do agents communicate with each other?
3. What's the performance overhead?
4. How difficult is it to add new agents?
5. What are the deployment requirements?
6. How do you handle errors and failures?
7. What's the cost of running this system?

### Technical Requirements for Demo

Before presentation:
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all agents are running
docker ps

# Check dashboard is accessible
curl http://localhost:8500

# Have .env file configured with API keys
```

### Backup Plan

If live demo fails:
1. Have screenshots ready
2. Prepare a video recording as backup
3. Be ready to explain conceptually
4. Show code structure instead
