    # Core analysis parameters
    target_symbols: List[str]
    analysis_type: str
    risk_tolerance: str
    
    # Advanced workflow state
    last_active_agent: str
    completed_analyses: Dict[str, AnalysisResult]
    approval_required: bool
    risk_alerts: List[RiskAlert]
    
    # Market-aware features
