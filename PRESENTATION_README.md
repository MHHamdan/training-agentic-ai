## üîß Technical Requirements

### System Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Main dashboard should be accessible
curl http://localhost:8000

# Key agents should respond
curl http://localhost:8517  # AI Assistant
curl http://localhost:8513  # Stock Analysis  
curl http://localhost:8510  # Research Agent
```

### Browser Setup (Recommended)
```
Tab 1: presentation.html (Full screen)
Tab 2: http://localhost:8000 (Dashboard)
Tab 3: http://localhost:8517 (AI Assistant)
Tab 4: http://localhost:8513 (Stock Analysis)
Tab 5: http://localhost:8510 (Research Agent)
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Presentation Won't Load
```bash
# Ensure you're opening the HTML file in a browser
# Some browsers block local file access - try:
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080/presentation.html
```

### If Agents Are Offline
```bash
# Restart all agents
./stop_all_agents.sh
./start_all_agents.sh

# Check Docker status
docker-compose ps

# Restart specific agent if needed
docker-compose restart [agent-name]
```

### If Demos Fail During Presentation
1. **Stay calm** - use it as a teaching moment
2. **Switch to presentation** slides with architecture
3. **Use prepared screenshots** of successful runs  
4. **Focus on theoretical discussion**
